Sure, let's discuss the product modality for the article about Bukit Vista. 

Considering the nature of the task and the customer's demand for an impactful article, I believe a blog post would be the most suitable modality.

Title:"{title}" We have decided to complete the task through publishing copywriting and graphic art written in a .md file.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get the perfect copywriting. You will first lay out the copywriting skeleton that will be necessary. You will do internet search about each part of the copywriting skeleton and write a summary in order to fill in the skeleton. You must not directly copy the content from the internet and always store the source of the information with full reference link. You will write the content as a markdown code. The code must strictly follow a markdown format. For example: article.md ``` BALI'S BEST BEACHES TO VISIT IN 2023 Pack your sunscreen and your fave bikini, wrap up your sarong and prep your hottest summer playlist, because you'll want to tick off alllll of Bali's best beaches.  Seminyak Beach - best for everything  With beach clubs, bars and five-star hotels lining the golden sands, Seminyak Beach is a sun-soaked, hedonistic playground! If being in the heart of Bali's oceanfront action is your kinda thang, then Seminyak Beach is the place for you. Along this impressive 5km stretch of golden sand, you'll find beach bars aplenty, five-star hotels and Seminyak's very best restaurants just footsteps from the waves - not to mention world-famous beach clubs in every direction. Beginning on the outskirts of Kuta, trailing all the way up to the coastal corners of Canggu, Seminyak Beach is a holiday destination in itself. Learn to surf in the gentle whitewash, soak up the sunshine on a squishy sun bed, or settle into a comfy, colourful beanbag at La Plancha for a round of sundowners - Ibiza-style beats included.  Nusa Dua Beach - best for families  Treat the kids to sea, sunshine and shopping at Nusa Dua Beach! A seemingly endless stretch of powder white perfection, Nusa Dua Beach is so flawless, it almost looks manmade. It borders the coastline of Nusa Dua's resort area, fringed by manicured lawns and five-star hotels that have been tastefully sheltered by palm trees and natural building materials. ``` Then you will output the content of each file including complete code.. The file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code: FILENAME ```LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE ``` |

# BALI'S BEST BEACHES TO VISIT IN 2023

Pack your sunscreen and your fave bikini, wrap up your sarong and prep your hottest summer playlist, because you'll want to tick off alllll of Bali's best beaches.

1. Seminyak Beach - best for everything

_With beach clubs, bars and five-star hotels lining the golden sands, Seminyak Beach is a sun-soaked, hedonistic playground!_

If being in the heart of Bali's oceanfront action is your kinda thang, then Seminyak Beach is the place for you. Along this impressive 5km stretch of golden sand, you'll find beach bars aplenty, five-star hotels and Seminyak's very best restaurants just footsteps from the waves - not to mention world-famous beach clubs in every direction. Beginning on the outskirts of Kuta, trailing all the way up to the coastal corners of Canggu, Seminyak Beach is a holiday destination in itself. Learn to surf in the gentle whitewash, soak up the sunshine on a squishy sun bed, or settle into a comfy, colourful beanbag at La Plancha for a round of sundowners - Ibiza-style beats included.

2. Nusa Dua Beach - best for families

_Treat the kids to sea, sunshine and shopping at Nusa Dua Beach!_

A seemingly endless stretch of powder white perfection, Nusa Dua Beach is so flawless, it almost looks manmade. It borders the coastline of Nusa Dua's resort area, fringed by manicured lawns and five-star hotels that have been tastefully sheltered by palm trees and natural building materials.
